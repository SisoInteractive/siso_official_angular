                                frog and home speaker manufacturer Sound United identified a $100 million business opportunity in personal audio. To compete with lifestyle brand leaders, Sound United asked frog to develop a long-view strategy, a portfolio of new products, and a refresh of Sound United's brands; BOOM, Polk and Definitive Technologies. We created unique brand position for the brands as well as nine individual products.
                                Several rounds of ethnographic and market research were conducted to identify target segments. Three distinct customer groups emerged with clear preferences around features, functionality, price, and of course, style.

                                With a mixture of vintage and modern styling, Polk Audio's classic appeal resonates with consumers nostalgic for heritage products. With Polk Audio’s Nue Era headphones, the rebranded line introduces itself as a heritage brand tailored to music lovers who value personal style. Tortoise and champagne gold finishing harken back an era of handcrafted devices, while state-of-the-art headphone technology provides immersive sound in a small package. The Buckle and Hinge feature real metal construction that stands out in a sea of plastic competitors. Protein leather headphones and contrast stitching reflect the same attention to detail as the rich warm soundstage.
